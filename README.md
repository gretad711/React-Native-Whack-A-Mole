# Whack-A-Mole App

### The whack-a-mole app was built with react-native. Upon opening the app, the user is greeted with a homescreen. The homescreen displays the title of the game, touchable text that says 'play now' and an image of a mole being whacked. The homescreen also features a top navigation bar. The navigation bar displays the word "HomeScreen" and is not clickable on the homescreen. To play the game, the user must click on the play now text located beneath the title.

=====================

### Once the user clicks 'play now' text, they are taken to the gamescreen. The gamescreen includes a top navigation bar. Clicking on the back arrow navigates the user to the homescreen. The gamescreen displays the title of the app, timer, score and the holes and moles. The game immediately starts when the user arrives at the gamescreen page. The moles appear and disappear in a random hole. The mole with stay visible for a random number of seconds.

=====================

## Instructions

### When the mole appears, the user must press on the mole before it disappears.To score a point, the user must click on the mole. The user will have 30 seconds to score as many points as possible. The game ends after 30 seconds.
