# Whack-A-Mole App

### The whack-a-mole app was built with react-native. Upon opening the app, the user is greeted with a homepage. The homepage displays the title of the game, touchable text that says 'play now' and an image of a mole being whacked. The homepage also features a top navigation bar. The navigation link is not clickable on the homepage. To play the game, the user must click on the play now text to start the game.

=====================

### Once the user clicks 'play now', they are taken to the gamescreen. The gamescreen has the top navigation bar. Clicking on the back arrow navigates the user to the homepage. The gamescreen displays the title of the app, timer, score and the holes and moles. The game immediately starts when the user arrives at the gamescreen.

## How to play

### The moles appear and disappear in a random order. The mole with stay visible for a random number of seconds. To score a point, the user must click on the mole before it disappears. The user will have 30 seconds to score as many points as possible. The game ends after 30 seconds.
